Description: External preference mapping technique is commonly used in sensory analysis
    field to explain consumer preferences in function of sensory attributes of products
    Danzart(1998) (<doi:10.1006/fstl.1998.0373>). The package provides map visualization
    with options in dimension reduction methods and prediction models from linear and
    non linear regressions. A smoothed version of the map performed using LOESS algorithm
    is available. A comparison approach of maps stability from different features before
    and after smoothing is provided. A 'shiny' application is included. It presents an
    easy GUI for the implemented functions as well as a comparative tool of fit models
    using several criteria. Basic analysis such as characterization of products,
    panelists and sessions likewise consumer segmentation are available.
