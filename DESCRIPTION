Description: External preference mapping technique is commonly used in sensory analysis
    field to connect consumer rating data that contains liking scores to sensory data
    that incorporates sensory attributes' evaluations of the perceived products
    Danzart(1998) (<doi:10.1006/fstl.1998.0373>). SensMap package provides the
    mapping visualization from several features : options in dimension reduction methods
    and prediction models ranging from linear to non linear regressions. A smoothed
    version of the map performed using LOESS algorithm is available. A selection process
    of map stability is provided. A 'shiny' application is included. It presents an easy
    GUI for the implemented functions as well as a comparative tool of fit models
    using several criteria. Basic analysis such as characterization of products,
    panelists and sessions likewise consumer segmentation are also made available.
