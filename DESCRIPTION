Description: Obtain external preference map to explain consumer preferences in function of sensory
    attributes of products (K.Greenhoff et al. (1994) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-2171-6_6>)
    with options in dimension reduction methods and prediction models from linear and non linear regressions.
    A smoothed version of the map is available and a comparison of maps stability from different features
    before and after smoothing is provided which may help industrials to make good decisions about characteristics
    of new product development.
    A 'shiny' application is included. It presents an easy GUI for
    the implemented functions as well as a comparative tool of fit models
    performance using several criteria. Basic analysis such as characterization
    of products, panelists and sessions likewise consumers segmentation are available.
