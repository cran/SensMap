Description: External preference mapping technique is commonly used in sensory analysis
    field to explain consumer preferences in function of sensory attributes of products
    Danzart (1998) (<https://www.lavoisier.fr/livre/agro-alimentaire/evaluation-
    sensorielle-3e-ed/depledt/descriptif-9782743009977>). The package provides map
    visualization with options in dimension reduction methods and prediction models
    from linear and non linear regressions. A smoothed version of the map performed using
    LOESS algorithm is available. A comparison approach of maps stability from different
    features before and after smoothing is provided. A 'shiny' application is included.
    It presents an easy GUI for the implemented functions as well as a comparative tool
    of fit models using several criteria. Basic analysis such as characterization of
    products, panelists and sessions likewise consumer segmentation are available.
