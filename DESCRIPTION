Description: Provides Sensory and Consumer Data 
    mapping and analysis <doi:10.14569/IJACSA.2017.081266>. The mapping visualization is made available
    from several features : options in dimension reduction methods and prediction models ranging from 
    linear to non linear regressions. A smoothed version of the map performed using locally weighted regression algorithm 
    is available. A selection process of map stability is provided. A 'shiny' application is included. 
    It presents an easy GUI for the implemented functions as well as a comparative tool of fit models
    using several criteria. Basic analysis such as characterization of products,
    panelists and sessions likewise consumer segmentation are also made available.
